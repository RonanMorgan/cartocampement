[pytest]
pythonpath = . app
# Add other configurations like markers, coverage settings, etc. later if needed
# Example: testpaths = tests
# Example: python_files = test_*.py
# Example: addopts = --cov=app --cov-report=html
# For now, pythonpath should be enough to help pytest find 'app' module
# if tests are run from 'backend' directory.
# If running from root of map_project, pythonpath = backend backend/app
# Assuming execution from 'backend' directory.
